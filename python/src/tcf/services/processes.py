IProcesses service provides access to the target OS's process
information, allows to start and terminate a process, and allows
to attach and detach a process for debugging. Debug services,
like IMemory and IRunControl, require a process to be attached
before they can access it.

If a process is started by this service, its standard input/output streams are
available for client to read/write using Streams service. Stream type of such
streams is set to "Processes".
