"""
Streams service is a generic interface to support streaming of data between host and remote agents.

The service supports:
 1. Asynchronous overlapped data streaming: multiple 'read' or 'write' command can be issued at same time, both peers
 can continue data processing concurrently with data transmission.
 2. Multicast: multiple clients can receive data from same stream.
 3. Subscription model: clients are required to expressed interest in particular streams by subscribing for the service.
 4. Flow control: peers can throttle data flow of individual streams by delaying 'read' and 'write' commands.
