"""
Locator service uses transport layer to search for peers and to collect data about
peer's attributes and capabilities (services). Discovery mechanism depends on transport protocol
and is part of that protocol handler. Targets, known to other hosts, can be found through
remote instances of Locator service. Automatically discovered targets require no further
configuration. Additional targets can be configured manually.

Clients should use protocol.getLocator() to obtain local instance of locator,
then locator.getPeers() can be used to get list of available peers (hosts and targets).
