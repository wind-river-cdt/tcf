"""
File System service provides file transfer (and more generally file
system access) functionality in TCF. The service design is
derived from SSH File Transfer Protocol specifications.

     Request Synchronization and Reordering

The protocol and implementations MUST process requests relating to
the same file in the order in which they are received.  In other
words, if an application submits multiple requests to the server, the
results in the responses will be the same as if it had sent the
requests one at a time and waited for the response in each case.  For
example, the server may process non-overlapping read/write requests
to the same file in parallel, but overlapping reads and writes cannot
be reordered or parallelized.  However, there are no ordering
restrictions on the server for processing requests from two different
file transfer connections.  The server may interleave and parallelize
them at will.

There are no restrictions on the order in which responses to
outstanding requests are delivered to the client, except that the
server must ensure fairness in the sense that processing of no
request will be indefinitely delayed even if the client is sending
other requests so that there are multiple outstanding requests all
the time.

There is no limit on the number of outstanding (non-acknowledged)
requests that the client may send to the server.  In practice this is
limited by the buffering available on the data stream and the queuing
performed by the server.  If the server's queues are full, it should
not read any more data from the stream, and flow control will prevent
the client from sending more requests.

     File Names

This protocol represents file names as strings.  File names are
assumed to use the slash ('/') character as a directory separator.

File names starting with a slash are "absolute", and are relative to
the root of the file system.  Names starting with any other character
are relative to the user's default directory (home directory). Client
can use 'user()' command to retrieve current user home directory.

Servers SHOULD interpret a path name component ".." as referring to
the parent directory, and "." as referring to the current directory.
If the server implementation limits access to certain parts of the
file system, it must be extra careful in parsing file names when
enforcing such restrictions.  There have been numerous reported
security bugs where a ".." in a path name has allowed access outside
the intended area.

An empty path name is valid, and it refers to the user's default
directory (usually the user's home directory).

Otherwise, no syntax is defined for file names by this specification.
Clients should not make any other assumptions however, they can
splice path name components returned by readdir() together
using a slash ('/') as the separator, and that will work as expected.
