"""
Breakpoint is represented by unique identifier and set of properties.
Breakpoint identifier (String id) needs to be unique across all hosts and targets.

Breakpoint properties (Map<String,Object>) is extendible collection of named attributes,
which define breakpoint location and behavior. This module defines some common
attribute names (see PROP_*), host tools and target agents may support additional attributes.

For each breakpoint a target agent maintains another extendible collection of named attributes:
breakpoint status (Map<String,Object>, see STATUS_*). While breakpoint properties are
persistent and represent user input, breakpoint status reflects dynamic target agent reports
about breakpoint current state, like actual addresses where breakpoint is planted or planting errors.
