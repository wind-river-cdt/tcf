"""
This is an optional service that can be implemented by a peer.
If implemented, the service can be used for monitoring system activity and utilization.
It provides list of running processes, different process attributes like command line, environment, etc.,
and some resource utilization data. The service can be used by a client to provide functionality
similar to Unix 'top' utility or Windows 'Task Manager'.
