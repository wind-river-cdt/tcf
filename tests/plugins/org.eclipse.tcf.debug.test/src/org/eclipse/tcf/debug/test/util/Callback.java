 * Used to monitor the result of an asynchronous request.  Because of the
 * asynchronous nature of DSF code, a very large number of methods needs to 
 * signal the result of an operation through a call-back.  This class is the base 
 * class for such call backs.  
 * <p>
 * The intended use of this class, is that a client who is calling an asynchronous 
 * method, will sub-class Callback, and implement the method {@link #handleCompleted()}, 
 * or any of the other <code>handle...</code> methods, in order to interpret the 
 * results of the request.  The object implementing the asynchronous method is required 
 * to call the {@link #done()} method on the request monitor object that it received 
 * as an argument.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The error the returned by #getError() can be used to 
 * determine the success or failure of the asynchronous operation.  By convention
 * the error value returned by asynchronous method should be interpreted as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>null</code> - Result is a success.  In DataCallback, getData() should
 *     return a value.</li>
 * <li>non-<code>null</code> - An error condition that should probably be reported 
 *     to the user.</li>
 * <li><code>CancellationException</code> - The request was canceled, and the 
 *     asynchronous method was not completed.</li>
 * </ul>  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Callback constructor accepts an optional "parent" request monitor.  If a 
 * parent monitor is specified, it will automatically be invoked by this monitor when 
 * the request is completed.  The parent option is useful when implementing a method 
 * which is asynchronous (and accepts a request monitor as an argument) and which itself 
 * calls another asynchronous method to complete its operation.  For example, in the 
 * request monitor implementation below, the implementation only needs to override 
 * <code>handleSuccess()</code>, because the base implementation will handle notifying the 
 * parent <code>rm</code> in case the <code>getIngredients()</code> call fails. 
 * <pre>
 *     public void createCupCakes(final DataCallback<CupCake[]> rm) {
 *         getIngredients(new DataCallback<Ingredients>(fExecutor, rm) {
 *                 public void handleSuccess() {
 *                     rm.setData( new CupCake(getData().getFlour(), getData().getSugar(), 
 *                                             getData().getBakingPowder()));
 *                     rm.done();  
 *                 }
 *             });
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
