/**
 * ContextQuery allows to search for context that match a pattern.
 *
 * Query Syntax and Semantics
 *
 *        query = [ "/" ], { part, "/" }, part ;
 *        part = string | "*" | "**" | properties ;
 *        properties = property, { ",", property } ;
 *        property = string, "=", value ;
 *        value = string | number | boolean ;
 *        string = quoted string | symbol ;
 *        quoted string = '"', {any-character - ('"' | '\') | ('\', ('"' | '\'))}, '"' ;
 *        symbol = letter, { letter | digit } ;
 *        number = digit, { digit } ;
 *        boolean = "true" | "false" ;
 *        letter = ? A-Z, a-z or _ ? ;
 *        digit = ? 0-9 ? ;
 *        any-character = ? any character ? ;
 *
 * To give a feel for the syntax, here are some examples, and what a user
 * might mean when providing such a query:
 *
 * httpd
 *        Matches all contexts named "httpd".
 *
 * pid=4711
 *        Matches any context with a property pid, which has the value 4711.
 *
 * /server/**
 *        Matches all contexts which are decendants of the top level context
 *        named "server".
 *
 * "Linux 2.6.14"/Kernel/*
 *       Matches all kernel processes in operating systems named "Linux 2.6.14".
 *
 * pid=4711/*
 *        All threads in processes with the pid 4711.
 *
 * /server/** /HasState=true
 *        All threads which are decendants of the context "server".
 *
 * The contexts are assumed to be placed in a tree. Each context has zero
 * or one parent. If it has zero parents it is a child of the root of the
 * tree.
 *
 * A query consists of a sequence of parts separated by "/". This
 * sequence specifies a path through the context tree. A context matches
 * the query if the last part of the query matches the properties of the
 * context and the parent of the context matches the query excluding the
 * last part. The properties of a context matches a part if each property
 * specified in the part matches the property of the same name in the
 * context or if the name of the context matches the string specified in
 * the part. There are also two wild cards. The part "*" matches any
 * context. The part "**" matches any sequence of contexts. If the query
 * starts with a "/" the first part of the query must match a child of
 * the root of the context tree.
